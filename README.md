# mimir-4-bot
(not optimized for anyone to use, you should update files and add map name manually if you want to change the route bot will take)
(you need to open file and hard code /manually write the name of the window you want the bot to work on, example Mir4G[0] or Mir4G[1] etc)
(Game should be on chinesse, this simplifies many texts "overflowing" screen when playing in other languages, wich causes some bugs when text appears in "transparent" background and is hard to check for the bot)

Bot works in a class state way.
Constantly taking screenshots of the game and analyzing to change bot state according to situation
there are few constant checkers that checks: current map / danger situation or death / gathering or collecting things status / moving status / 
some states currently programed are: opening chest / gathering / moving / danger / returning to work map /
I think there is a few more wich I stopped using long ago

video showing
map creation tool and activating bot to start one preselected trayectory searching chests / orbs in mirage ship, couldn't find much orbs to collect during video, server is full of automated bots already
